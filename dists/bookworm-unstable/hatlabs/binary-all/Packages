Description: Blocking ads & tracking Network-widly
 Difference from Traditional Ad Blockers. Unlike traditional ad-blocking plugins that work only on individual devices, AdGuard Home offers a network-wide solution. By setting it up, you can block ads and trackers across all your home devices without needing to install any additional software on each device. This means comprehensive protection with minimal effort.
 .
 How AdGuard Home Works and How to Use It. AdGuard Home functions as a DNS server that reroutes tracking domains to a "black hole," effectively preventing your devices from connecting to these servers. This blocks ads and trackers not only on your computer but also on your smartphone and smart home devices. To start using AdGuard Home, deploy it on your device, then change the DNS address assigned by DHCP on your router to the IP address of your AdGuard Home server.
 .
 Benefits of Deploying AdGuard Home on Zima Private Cloud. Deploying AdGuard Home on a Zima device simplifies network-wide ad and tracker blocking, providing a seamless and secure browsing experience for all your home devices. With Zima, you gain the flexibility to monitor network activity and create custom filtering rules tailored to your needs.

 A tunneling daemon by Cloudflare that safely exposes your web servers into the internet.
 .
 Cloudflare Tunnel offers an easy way to expose web servers securely to the internet, without opening up firewall ports and configuring ACLs. Cloudflare Tunnel also ensures requests route through Cloudflare before reaching the web server, so you can be sure attack traffic is stopped with Cloudflare’s WAF and Unmetered DDoS mitigation, and authenticated with Access if you’ve enabled those features for your account.
 .
 The software provides a seamless way to securely expose web servers to the internet without configuring firewall ports or access control lists (ACLs). All requests are routed through Cloudflare before reaching your web server, leveraging Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) and unmetered DDoS mitigation to block attack traffic, with optional authentication via Cloudflare Access if enabled. With its intuitive Web interface and efficient tunnel management, this tool is the perfect solution for securely deploying web services.

 The Unifi-controller software is a powerful, enterprise wireless software engine ideal for high-density client deployments requiring low latency and high uptime performance.

 For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System Settings > Controller Configuration and set the Controller Hostname/IP to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox "Override inform host with controller hostname/IP" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).

 Because the network application runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices.
 So, for it to adopt other devices, it is required to use port `8080` and change the inform IP address. To do so, go in settings and search for the `Inform Host` option, there select override and set the address to that of the host.
 Often, it is also needed to ssh into the devices you want to adopt and manually set the inform IP address, the command needed for doing so is `set-inform http://HOST-ADDRESS:8080/inform`.
